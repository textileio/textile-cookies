# Project

This project was bootstrapped with Textile's [`textile-cookies`](https://github.com/textileio/textile-cookies).

## Textile

[Textile](https://www.textile.io) provides encrypted, recoverable, schema-based, and cross-application data storage built on [IPFS](https://github.com/ipfs) and [libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p). We like to think of it as a decentralized data wallet with built-in protocols for sharing and recovery, or more simply, **an open and programmable iCloud**.

This cookiecutter project is designed to showcase the features of `js-http-client`, which is available on [`npmjs.com`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@textileio/js-http-client) under the `@textile` scope. `js-http-client` provides access to an underlying `textile-go` node's REST API, adding various simplified APIs to support in-browser and programmatic desktop access. For the most part, the API would mimic the command-line and/or mobile APIs of `textile-go`, with some browser-specific enhancements. It works well in conjunction with the Textile [desktop Tray app](https://github.com/textileio/go-textile#tray-app).
